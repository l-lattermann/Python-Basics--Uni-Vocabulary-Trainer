Q: What are the basal ganglia and their function? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	subcortical nuclei
	•	motor control
	•	spontaneity regulation
	•	affect modulation

The basal ganglia are a group of deep brain structures responsible for voluntary motor control and cognitive-emotional integration. They help regulate movement initiation and mood.
Q: What is the difference between cognitive and affective mental processes? [3.1 Reward and Avoidance System]
A:
	•	cognitive = processing
	•	affective = excitation
	•	dual activation
	•	internal/external triggers

Cognitive processes involve receiving, processing, and storing information, while affective processes involve emotional excitation that motivates behavior. Though often intertwined, one type may dominate, and both can be triggered internally or externally.
Q: What are the main functions of the limbic system? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:
	•	emotional evaluation
	•	memory formation
	•	behavioral response
	•	learning and motivation

The limbic system governs how sensory input is emotionally evaluated, whether an experience is positive or negative, and how it is stored in memory. It also supports adaptive behavioral responses and learning.
Q: What is the fornix and what is its function in the limbic system? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:
	•	limbic fiber tract
	•	communication bridge
	•	hippocampal connection

A:
	•	memory
	•	auditory processing
	•	emotions
	•	speech comprehension

The temporal lobe (lobus temporalis) is involved in memory formation, language comprehension, and emotional regulation. It houses the amygdala and auditory cortex.
Q: What is the role of the hypothalamus in the limbic system? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:
	•	vegetative regulation
	•	memory involvement
	•	anterior/posterior split
	•	limbic integration

The hypothalamus controls key bodily functions: its anterior region manages organ-related autonomic functions, while the posterior region participates in memory processing—both contributing to limbic system operations.
Q: What is the function of the reward and avoidance system in human behavior? [3.1 Reward and Avoidance System]
A:
	•	reward = pursue positive states
	•	avoidance = prevent negative states
	•	anticipatory motivation
	•	emotional signaling

The reward and avoidance system motivates behavior by signaling which stimuli are desirable or aversive. Positive emotions activate the reward system, prompting approach, while anticipated negative emotions activate the avoidance system, prompting withdrawal (Häusel, 2012).
Q: What is the function of the thalamus, and why is it called the “gateway to consciousness”? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	sensory relay
	•	cerebral cortex input
	•	attention control
	•	awareness hub

The thalamus relays sensory data to the cortex and modulates attention. It is termed the “gateway to consciousness” due to its central role in awareness and perception.
Q: What is the difference between the thalamus and the hypothalamus? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:
	• thalamus: relay station for sensory input (except smell); regulates consciousness and alertness
	• hypothalamus: controls autonomic functions and hormones; regulates homeostasis and emotions

The thalamus acts as the brain’s central relay for sensory information and supports consciousness and sleep. In contrast, the hypothalamus, located just below it, governs involuntary body functions such as hunger, temperature, and emotional responses, and manages hormone release via the pituitary gland.
Q: Which neurotransmitters and hormones contribute to reward and avoidance feelings? [3.1 Reward and Avoidance System]
A:
	•	dopamine – motivation, reward
	•	serotonin – calm, well-being
	•	norepinephrine – arousal, stress
	•	acetylcholine – learning, attention
	•	endorphins – happiness
	•	oxytocin – bonding, trust

These messengers regulate mental states. Dopamine and endorphins fuel reward; serotonin and acetylcholine promote calm focus and learning; norepinephrine raises arousal; oxytocin fosters social trust (Kroeber-Riel & Gröppel-Klein, 2019).
Q: What structures are included in the brainstem and what are their functions? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	midbrain
	•	pons
	•	medulla oblongata

The brainstem includes the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. It manages core life-support functions like breathing, heart rate, and sleep regulation.
Q: What is the function of the amygdala in emotional processing? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:
	•	fear regulation
	•	memory encoding
	•	hormone triggering
	•	defensive behavior

The amygdala processes emotional stimuli, especially fear, and coordinates with the hippocampus to encode emotional memories. It also initiates physiological responses such as hormonal release and behavioral defense reactions.
Q: What functions are associated with the frontal lobe? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	motor control
	•	decision-making
	•	speech production
	•	pattern recognition

The frontal lobe (lobus frontalis) controls voluntary movements and is involved in higher-order functions like planning, language production, and recognizing patterns.
Q: How does the limbic system contribute to memory and learning? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:
	•	emotional filtering
	•	memory tagging
	•	adaptive learning
	•	experience evaluation

The limbic system processes sensory data by emotionally tagging it and organizing it in memory. This emotional tagging helps in recognizing similar future events and adapting behavior accordingly.
Q: What are the roles of the gyrus cinguli and its subdivisions? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:
	•	affect regulation
	•	memory formation
	•	motor and pain integration
	•	anterior/posterior parts

The gyrus cinguli is the largest limbic structure and contributes to emotional processing, motor control, attention, and long-term memory. Its anterior and posterior segments serve distinct regulatory and integrative roles.
Q: What functions are attributed to the septum in the limbic system? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:
	•	autonomic regulation
	•	emotional experience
	•	memory processing
	•	limbic communication

The septum helps regulate internal bodily states, emotional tone, and certain memory functions. It acts as a mediator between emotional states and physiological responses.
Q: What does the cerebellum do and how is it structured? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	movement coordination
	•	two hemispheres
	•	vermis cerebelli

Q: What are the components and role of the diencephalon? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	thalamus
	•	hypothalamus
	•	subthalamus
	•	epithalamus

The diencephalon links the brainstem and cerebrum and regulates sensory input, emotions, vision, and autonomic functions. Each substructure contributes to brain–body coordination.
Q: What is the presumed function of the mamillary body? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:
	•	memory consolidation
	•	emotional processing
	•	functional speculation
	•	limbic participation

Although its exact role is unclear, the mamillary body is believed to be involved in processing emotions and consolidating memory, contributing to limbic system functions.
Q: What brain regions are associated with language processing, and how do they demonstrate hemispheric asymmetry? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	Broca’s area
	•	Wernicke’s area
	•	dominant hemisphere
	•	language lateralization

Language is primarily processed in Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas, usually located in the hemisphere opposite the dominant hand. This represents a clear example of hemispheric asymmetry in brain function.
Q: What brain region plays a central role in the reward system, and how does it function? [3.1 Reward and Avoidance System]
A:
	•	mesolimbic system
	•	nucleus accumbens
	•	reward evaluation
	•	dopamine release

The nucleus accumbens evaluates stimuli for their potential to trigger reward and coordinates with limbic inputs to initiate dopamine release when a stimulus is positively classified, reinforcing behavior (Brandstätter et al., 2018).
Q: What forms the central nervous system according to Schütz (2015)? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	brain
	•	medulla oblongata

	•	neural core

According to Schütz (2015), the central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and medulla oblongata, forming the core of information processing and transmission in the human body.
Q: What is the basal forebrain and what does it control? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:
	•	vigilance
	•	attention regulation
	•	substantia innominata
	•	arousal systems

The basal forebrain, also called the substantia innominata, contains several nuclei involved in regulating attention, alertness, and cortical arousal. It plays a key role in cognitive readiness.
Q: What does the parietal lobe control? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	spatial awareness
	•	tactile processing
	•	speech processing
