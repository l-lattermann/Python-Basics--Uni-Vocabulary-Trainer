Q: What are Hassenzahl’s three levels of goals in UX?
A: (1) Motor goals deal with physical actions (how), (2) action goals describe specific activities (what), and (3) being goals reflect motivations and identities (why). Positive user experiences emerge when systems support all three levels, especially the being goals.
Q: What are the three core activities in the UX design process?
A: According to Jonas (2006), the UX design process includes: (1) analysis – understanding the current state, (2) projection – generating ideas, and (3) synthesis – developing and implementing concrete design solutions. These activities span the broader macroprocess.
Q: How does Garrett distinguish between functional and informational UX?
A: Garrett divides each level into two perspectives: the function side, focusing on user tasks and actions, and the information side, focusing on content and meaning. This dual view helps identify both interaction and content-related design issues.
Q: How does the DIN EN ISO 9241-210 model describe UX design?
A: This model emphasizes an iterative user-centered process that continually tests and refines solutions based on user feedback. It outlines the importance of aligning product behavior with user expectations but doesn’t focus on divergence/convergence or method choice.
Q: How is “user experience” (UX) defined according to DIN EN ISO 9241-210?
A: User experience is defined as the perceptions and reactions of a person resulting from the actual or expected use of a product, system, or service. This includes emotions, thoughts, preferences, physical and psychological responses, behaviors, and accomplishments that occur before, during, and after use.
Q: How did UX design contribute to Apple’s turnaround?
A: Apple succeeded by combining management support with high-quality UX design. Products like the iMac and iPod emphasized aesthetic value and emotional appeal. Even when technically inferior, their symbolic product value and branding (e.g., white headphones) created strong consumer attachment.
Q: What key insight does Hassenzahl draw from the Wakeup Light example?
A: The product’s value lies not in its appearance but in the experience it creates. Hassenzahl stresses designing for emotional quality and user needs rather than sticking to traditional forms, urging designers to begin with the desired experience.
Q: What is the purpose of the analysis phase in user-centered design?
A: The analysis phase identifies user needs, intentions, tasks, and the context of system use. It provides the foundation for meaningful user requirements that guide the design and development of user-centered solutions.
Q: How do Hartson and Pyla define the components of user experience?
A: They outline four key components: (1) Usability – task performance ease; (2) Usefulness – practical value; (3) Emotional Impact – feelings evoked by use; (4) Meaningfulness – long-term personal significance of the product to the user.
Q: Which methods are commonly used in the analysis phase of UX design?
A: Common methods include contextual inquiry, touchpoint analysis, customer journey mapping, and personas. These approaches help uncover user behavior, pain points, and goals across different stages and contexts of interaction.
Q: What are Peter Morville’s seven facets of the UX Honeycomb?
A: (1) Useful: fulfills a real need; (2) Usable: easy to operate; (3) Desirable: aesthetically and emotionally appealing; (4) Findable: easy to locate and navigate; (5) Accessible: usable by people with disabilities; (6) Credible: inspires user trust; (7) Valuable: provides benefit to both user and business.
Q: What is the difference between projection and synthesis in UX design?
A: Projection involves generating ideas and envisioning possible solutions, while synthesis refers to shaping and concretizing these ideas into implementable concepts. In UX, both are grounded in what is technically feasible and directly usable by the end user.
Q: What is a conceptual model in interface design?
A: It’s the designer’s simplified representation of how a system works, crafted to match the user’s mental model. Unlike the technical implementation, it focuses on making the system understandable and transparent for users.
Q: What does user experience (UX) design focus on?
A: UX design focuses on the holistic experience people have with a product or service, emphasizing emotions, satisfaction, and usability during interaction. It looks beyond functionality to consider how users feel and what meanings they associate with their experiences.
Q: What are the four microprocess phases in UX design?
A: The microprocess involves: (1) research – collecting user data, (2) analysis – deriving user needs, (3) synthesis – generating and refining design ideas, and (4) realization – implementing and testing solutions. These phases often repeat iteratively.
Q: Who coined the term “user experience design” and why?
A: The term was popularized by cognitive psychologist Donald Norman in the 1980s while at Apple. He emphasized the need to design technology that aligns with human psychology, making systems intuitive and emotionally satisfying rather than just functional.
Q: How can UX activities be aligned with business objectives?
A: UX teams should prioritize projects that support business goals, such as reducing user errors, increasing task efficiency, or improving conversion. Linking UX metrics (like success rate or time-on-task) to business KPIs makes the value of UX clearer to stakeholders.
Q: What are the guiding principles of user-centered design according to the UK Design Council?
A: Core principles include: (1) user-centeredness, (2) inclusive and visual communication, (3) collaboration and co-creation, and (4) iteration. These guide the integration of UX into business culture and processes.
Q: What role did the internet and dotcom boom play in UX?
A: The rise of the web changed software marketing: users could try or preview software before purchase, making usability and user experience central to purchasing decisions. The dotcom boom pushed companies to invest in UX to remain competitive.
Q: How is “experience” defined in the context of UX?
A: Experience refers to the subjective, emotional, and cognitive response to using a product or service. It is shaped by past interactions, personal expectations, and contextual factors, and includes both real-time perception and retrospective evaluation.
Q: How does the revised Double Diamond model enhance UX practice?
A: The updated model adds a “methods bank,” integrating specific techniques and design principles. This recognizes that successful UX work is not only about diverging and converging, but also about applying the right tools to ensure user-centeredness and iterative learning.
Q: What are Jesse James Garrett’s five elements of UX design?
A: Garrett identifies five levels: (1) Strategy – goals of users and company; (2) Scope – features and content; (3) Structure – logical relationships and navigation; (4) Skeleton (Grid) – layout and interface structure; (5) Surface – visuals and interaction elements. Together, these levels move from abstract goals to concrete designs.
