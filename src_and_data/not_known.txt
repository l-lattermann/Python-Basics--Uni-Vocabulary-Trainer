Q: What factors influence the strength and impact of goals? [3.2 Motives and Goals]
A:
	•	expectancy-value (feasibility × value)
	•	feedback
	•	task complexity
	•	situational factors

According to goal-setting theory (Locke & Latham, 2002), clearly defined and challenging goals enhance performance. Key factors include feedback, commitment, perceived importance, and the ability to perform the task.

Q: What key functions are attributed to the temporal lobe? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	memory
	•	auditory processing
	•	emotions
	•	speech comprehension

The temporal lobe (lobus temporalis) is involved in memory formation, language comprehension, and emotional regulation. It houses the amygdala and auditory cortex.
Q: What are goals and how do they regulate behavior? [3.2 Motives and Goals]
A:
	•	desired future state
	•	internal representation
	•	behavioral direction
	•	incentive anticipation

Goals are mental representations of desired outcomes. They guide long-term behavior by enabling planning, control, and sustained motivation. Goals differ from wishes through commitment and trigger volitional regulation (Austin & Vancouver, 1996).

The thalamus relays sensory data to the cortex and modulates attention. It is termed the “gateway to consciousness” due to its central role in awareness and perception.
Q: What rules apply when building visual hierarchy through font size? [6.2 Effect of Typography]
A:
	•	use no more than three font sizes
	•	assign sizes to heading, subheading, and body text
	•	recommended sizes: 14–16 px (body), 18–22 px (subheading), up to 32 px (heading)

To build a clear visual hierarchy, font size should reflect the importance of content. Gordon (2021) advises using a maximum of three different font sizes—one each for headings, subheadings, and body text. This structured use of typography helps guide user attention effectively and keeps the layout visually organized.
Q: What is the difference between the thalamus and the hypothalamus? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:
	• thalamus: relay station for sensory input (except smell); regulates consciousness and alertness
	• hypothalamus: controls autonomic functions and hormones; regulates homeostasis and emotions

The thalamus acts as the brain’s central relay for sensory information and supports consciousness and sleep. In contrast, the hypothalamus, located just below it, governs involuntary body functions such as hunger, temperature, and emotional responses, and manages hormone release via the pituitary gland.
Q: Which neurotransmitters and hormones contribute to reward and avoidance feelings? [3.1 Reward and Avoidance System]
A:
	•	dopamine – motivation, reward
	•	serotonin – calm, well-being
	•	norepinephrine – arousal, stress
	•	acetylcholine – learning, attention
	•	endorphins – happiness
	•	oxytocin – bonding, trust

These messengers regulate mental states. Dopamine and endorphins fuel reward; serotonin and acetylcholine promote calm focus and learning; norepinephrine raises arousal; oxytocin fosters social trust (Kroeber-Riel & Gröppel-Klein, 2019).
Q: What structures are included in the brainstem and what are their functions? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]

Q: What are basic and secondary emotions, and how are they distinguished? [3.1 Reward and Avoidance System]
A:
	•	basic emotions = innate, universal
	•	secondary emotions = social, reflective
	•	Ekman’s classification
	•	emotional spectrum

Basic emotions (anger, fear, disgust, sadness, happiness) are genetically embedded and culturally universal. Some researchers add shame, surprise, and embarrassment. Secondary emotions—like guilt, pride, envy, and love—arise from deeper self-awareness and complex social relationships (Ekman, 2016).
Q: What is the overjustification effect and how does it affect motivation? [7.2 Design of the Flow Experience]
A:
	•	intrinsic motivation is undermined
	•	caused by excessive external rewards
	•	enjoyment becomes task-independent

The overjustification effect occurs when a person who initially engages in an activity out of intrinsic motivation begins to associate it primarily with external rewards (e.g., money, grades). As a result, their natural enjoyment or interest decreases. The task becomes a means to an end rather than something pursued for its own value—potentially disrupting flow and long-term engagement.
Q: What are the five traits in the Five Factor Model of Personality? [3.3 Personality Traits of the Human Being]
A:
	•	extraversion
	•	agreeableness
	•	conscientiousness
	•	neuroticism
	•	openness to experience

The Big Five model reduces human personality to five major traits. These are sociability (extraversion), empathy (agreeableness), perfectionism (conscientiousness), emotional stability (neuroticism), and curiosity (openness). It’s widely used but lacks detail for some applications.
Q: What are the components and role of the diencephalon? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	thalamus
	•	hypothalamus
	•	subthalamus
	•	epithalamus

The diencephalon links the brainstem and cerebrum and regulates sensory input, emotions, vision, and autonomic functions. Each substructure contributes to brain–body coordination.
Q: How is the term “experience” defined in the context of UX psychology? [1.1 Explanation of Terms]
A:
	•	knowledge dimension
	•	emotional dimension
	•	learning and feeling
	•	significant events

In UX psychology, “experience” refers to two key dimensions: (1) experience as knowledge gained through interaction and learning, and (2) experience as emotion—a subjective state triggered by important events or stimuli.
Q: What is important when using a Mixture of different fonts? [6.1 Basics of Typography]
A:
Fonts should be clearly different; if they are too similar, they must differ in size to remain distinguishable.
Q: What is the presumed function of the mamillary body? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:

Q: Does the brain follow fixed organizational rules throughout life? [2.3 Main Components of a Nerve Cell]
A:
	•	neuroplasticity
	•	lifelong change
	•	adaptability limits
	•	structural reorganization

The brain demonstrates neuroplasticity—the ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. This flexibility supports learning and recovery but diminishes with age.
Q: What brain regions are associated with language processing, and how do they demonstrate hemispheric asymmetry? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	Broca’s area
	•	Wernicke’s area
	•	dominant hemisphere
	•	language lateralization

Language is primarily processed in Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas, usually located in the hemisphere opposite the dominant hand. This represents a clear example of hemispheric asymmetry in brain function.
Q: What brain region plays a central role in the reward system, and how does it function? [3.1 Reward and Avoidance System]
A:
	•	mesolimbic system
	•	nucleus accumbens
	•	reward evaluation
	•	dopamine release

The nucleus accumbens evaluates stimuli for their potential to trigger reward and coordinates with limbic inputs to initiate dopamine release when a stimulus is positively classified, reinforcing behavior (Brandstätter et al., 2018).
Q: What forms the central nervous system according to Schütz (2015)? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	brain
	•	medulla oblongata
	•	signal transmission
	•	neural core

According to Schütz (2015), the central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and medulla oblongata, forming the core of information processing and transmission in the human body.
Q: What distinguishes emotions, feelings, affects, and moods? [3.1 Reward and Avoidance System]
A:
	•	feeling = interpretation
	•	affect = activation
	•	mood = diffuse, long-lasting
	•	emotion = object-related

Feelings are subjective interpretations of emotions, while affects are broader activation states encompassing emotions and moods. Moods last longer and lack specific triggers, whereas emotions are more intense, short-lived, and directed at particular events.
Q: What is the basal forebrain and what does it control? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:
	•	vigilance
	•	attention regulation
	•	substantia innominata
	•	arousal systems

The basal forebrain, also called the substantia innominata, contains several nuclei involved in regulating attention, alertness, and cortical arousal. It plays a key role in cognitive readiness.
Q: What are the three core needs in McClelland’s theory? [3.2 Motives and Goals]
A:
	•	achievement
	•	power
	•	affiliation

McClelland’s theory posits that all behavior stems from three core needs. Achievement involves striving for excellence; power reflects the desire to influence others; affiliation relates to the need for social bonds (Harrell & Stahl, 1984).
Q: What is the cerebrum and what is its basic anatomical structure? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	telencephalon
	•	two hemispheres
	•	corpus callosum
	•	cortex cerebri

The cerebrum, or telencephalon, is the brain’s largest region, divided into two hemispheres connected by the corpus callosum. It contains the insula and is covered by the cerebral cortex, which enables higher cognitive and sensory functions.
