Q: What distinguishes summative from formative usability testing? [Usability Testing]
A: Summative tests evaluate the finished system using quantitative data to assess effectiveness, while formative tests support ongoing design using qualitative insights.
Q: What does the GOMS model stand for and what is its purpose? [Usability Testing]
A: Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection rules — used to predict expert users’ task completion time on interfaces through analytical modeling.
Q: What are typical steps to plan and execute a usability test? [Usability Testing]
A: (1) Define target group, (2) Recruit participants, (3) Identify tasks, (4) Conduct evaluation, (5) Report results.
Q: Why is matching the test group to the target audience important? [Usability Testing]
A: It ensures that the test results are representative and actionable for the actual user base.

Q: What is an expert evaluation in usability testing? [Usability Testing]
A: A systematic inspection by usability experts using heuristics, checklists, or walkthroughs, without user involvement.
Q: Why is expert evaluation not a substitute for usability tests? [Usability Testing]
A: Because it lacks real user interaction and can miss issues that only occur in practice.
Q: What are the three main types of expert evaluations? [Usability Testing]
A: Heuristic evaluation, checklist-based evaluation, and cognitive walkthrough.
Q: What is a heuristic evaluation? [Usability Testing]
A: An evaluation using general usability principles to identify interface problems, based on established or custom heuristics.
Q: What is a standards inspection in usability evaluation? [Usability Testing]
A: An expert evaluation based on compliance with specific internal or external standards rather than general heuristics.
Q: What is a cognitive walkthrough? [Usability Testing]
A: A task-based expert evaluation assessing whether users can successfully navigate the system, focusing on cognitive effort.
Q: What is a pluralistic walkthrough? [Usability Testing]
A: A cognitive walkthrough involving users, developers, and experts evaluating a system independently, then merging results.
Q: How does a checklist-based evaluation differ from a heuristic one? [Usability Testing]
A: It uses specific attributes derived from heuristics that can be objectively checked, making it easier and less expertise-dependent.
Q: What is the main advantage of using observation in usability evaluation? [Usability Testing]
A: It reveals behavioral patterns that may complement or contradict users’ self-reports.
Q: What distinguishes participant from non-participant observation? [Usability Testing]
A: In participant observation, the observer joins the group; in non-participant, they observe without involvement.
Q: What is the difference between field and laboratory observation? [Usability Testing]
A: Field observations occur in natural environments; lab observations take place in controlled test settings.
Q: When is covert observation used and what are the ethical concerns? [Usability Testing]
A: Only when no other method is viable, due to ethical issues from observing without user consent.
Q: How do self-observation and external observation differ? [Usability Testing]
A: Self-observation is introspective and user-led, while external observation is conducted by an outsider.
Q: What distinguishes direct from indirect observation? [Usability Testing]
A: Direct observation focuses on live behavior; indirect examines outcomes or traces of past behavior.
Q: What is the role of technical mediation in observation? [Usability Testing]
A: Technically mediated observations use tools like video or audio, while unmediated rely on direct human perception.
Q: What is a diary study in usability research? [Usability Testing]
A: A self-observation method where participants regularly document usage experiences over time.
Q: Why are diary studies useful in UX research? [Usability Testing]
A: They allow long-term observation without disrupting natural user behavior and can cover remote users.
Q: What is a major challenge of diary studies? [Usability Testing]
A: Recruiting participants willing to document usage consistently over time.
Q: What determines the duration and frequency of diary study entries? [Usability Testing]
A: How often the system is used and how detailed the data needs to be.
Q: What is the difference between structured and unstructured diaries? [Usability Testing]
A: Structured diaries use predefined prompts for consistency; unstructured allow more open-ended input.
Q: What are the three types of structured diary studies? [Usability Testing]
A: Repeated surveys, usability test reports, and problem-triggered reports.
Q: What is the goal of problem reports in diary studies? [Usability Testing]
A: To identify specific usability issues as they occur, though they are less suitable for general behavior tracking.
Q: What is the Experience Sampling Method (ESM)? [Usability Testing]
A: A method where users are prompted at intervals to report on their experiences in real-time.
Q: How is ESM different from typical diary studies? [Usability Testing]
A: ESM uses timed or triggered prompts to capture immediate, context-sensitive self-reports.
Q: What formats can be used in ESM for capturing user input? [Usability Testing]
A: Questionnaires, free text, audio, video, or photos, depending on the research question.
Q: Why are interviews and questionnaires essential in UX evaluation? [Usability Testing]
A: They access emotional and hedonic user experience aspects that observation alone cannot capture.
Q: What is the benefit of standardized UX questionnaires? [Usability Testing]
A: They offer validated, comparable results and support reliable conclusions about system qualities.
Q: What should be considered when using multiple UX questionnaires? [Usability Testing]
A: Time burden on participants—short forms like AttrakDiff and VisAWI can help reduce it.
Q: Why are UX questionnaires often based on psychological models? [Usability Testing]
A: Because they capture core experiential aspects like emotion, aesthetics, and affective responses.
Q: What are unipolar and bipolar scales in UX research? [Usability Testing]
A: Bipolar scales rate between two opposites (e.g., beautiful–ugly), unipolar scales measure intensity of a single trait.
