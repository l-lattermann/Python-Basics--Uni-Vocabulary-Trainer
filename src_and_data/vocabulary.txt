	•	risk: external pressure and loss of intrinsic motivation

Gamification involves integrating game design elements—such as points, badges, and rankings—into non-game settings to enhance engagement and motivation (Deterding et al., 2011). It can support the flow experience by offering clear rules, immediate feedback, and challenging yet achievable goals. However, if poorly implemented, it may create social pressure or undermine intrinsic motivation, especially when used competitively or for external validation. A thoughtful design is essential for gamification to be effective and sustainable.
Q: What are the key Gestalt laws and their roles in visual perception and interface design? [5.1 Effect of Images]
A:
•	 proximity: elements with small distance to each other are perceived as belonging together
•	 similarity: objects that share visual properties are more likely to be perceived as belonging together
•	 good figure: people prefer to perceive designs that correspond to a simple and concise structure
•	 good continuation: elements on a continuous line or curve are perceived as belonging together
• closure: preference is given to closed structures as opposed to open structures
• common fate: elements that exhibit similar behavior are perceived as belonging together
• common region: elements in delimited areas are perceived as belonging together
• synchrony: elements that change simultaneously are perceived as belonging together
• connected elements: elements connected by a line are perceived as belonging together

Gestalt laws explain how people visually organize complex images into coherent wholes. They are foundational in interface design to guide user attention, improve grouping, and enhance readability. Each law provides a perceptual shortcut that helps users intuitively interpret visual elements and relationships within digital interfaces.

Q: What is the function of the reward and avoidance system in human behavior? [3.1 Reward and Avoidance System]
A:
	•	reward = pursue positive states
	•	avoidance = prevent negative states
	•	anticipatory motivation
	•	emotional signaling

The reward and avoidance system motivates behavior by signaling which stimuli are desirable or aversive. Positive emotions activate the reward system, prompting approach, while anticipated negative emotions activate the avoidance system, prompting withdrawal (Häusel, 2012).
Q: What is the primary function of the occipital lobe? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	vision processing
	•	lobus occipitalis
	•	visual cortex

	•	assign sizes to heading, subheading, and body text
	•	recommended sizes: 14–16 px (body), 18–22 px (subheading), up to 32 px (heading)

To build a clear visual hierarchy, font size should reflect the importance of content. Gordon (2021) advises using a maximum of three different font sizes—one each for headings, subheadings, and body text. This structured use of typography helps guide user attention effectively and keeps the layout visually organized.
Q: What is the difference between the thalamus and the hypothalamus? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:
	• thalamus: relay station for sensory input (except smell); regulates consciousness and alertness
	• hypothalamus: controls autonomic functions and hormones; regulates homeostasis and emotions

The thalamus acts as the brain’s central relay for sensory information and supports consciousness and sleep. In contrast, the hypothalamus, located just below it, governs involuntary body functions such as hunger, temperature, and emotional responses, and manages hormone release via the pituitary gland.
Q: How are emotions defined according to Kleinginna & Kleinginna (1981) and Meyer (2001)? [1.1 Explanation of Terms]
A:
	•	multidimensional change
	•	emotion episode

	•	time-limited occurrence

Kleinginna & Kleinginna (1981) define emotions as complex patterns involving feelings, physiological arousal, cognition, and behavior. Meyer (2001) adds that emotions are concrete, temporally dated experiences unique to individuals.
Q: Which academic disciplines contribute most to research in human–machine interaction? [1.3 Interaction of Psychology and Design]
A:
	•	psychology
	•	computer science
	•	engineering
	•	economics

According to Luther et al. (2020), psychology plays a central role in human–machine interaction research, complementing contributions from technical fields like computer science, engineering, and economics, especially in understanding human needs and behavior.
Q: Which neurotransmitters and hormones contribute to reward and avoidance feelings? [3.1 Reward and Avoidance System]
A:
	•	dopamine – motivation, reward
	•	serotonin – calm, well-being
	•	norepinephrine – arousal, stress
	•	acetylcholine – learning, attention
	•	endorphins – happiness
	•	oxytocin – bonding, trust

These messengers regulate mental states. Dopamine and endorphins fuel reward; serotonin and acetylcholine promote calm focus and learning; norepinephrine raises arousal; oxytocin fosters social trust (Kroeber-Riel & Gröppel-Klein, 2019).
Q: What are the aspects of the flow experience, and how are they expressed? [7.2 Design of the Flow Experience]
A:
	•	merging of action and consciousness: full focus without self-reflection
	•	focusing attention: narrowed mental field, temporal fading
	•	loss of ego: self-forgetfulness, becoming one with the task
	•	control: feeling of mastery over action and environment
	•	call to action and feedback: clear goals and direct feedback
	•	autotelic nature: activity is done for its own sake

Flow is a mental state in which individuals are completely absorbed in an activity. This includes a merging of action and awareness, intense concentration, and the fading of self-consciousness. Attention becomes sharply focused, and the perception of time may blur. Clear rules and immediate feedback allow a sense of control, and the activity is intrinsically rewarding—performed not for external rewards but for the joy of the task itself.
Q: What does Miller’s law state, and how is it applied in UX? [1.3 Interaction of Psychology and Design]
A:
	•	7±2 items
	•	working memory capacity
	•	design simplification
	•	cognitive limit

Miller’s law suggests that the average person can hold 5 to 9 items in short-term memory. In UX, this principle supports limiting the number of elements users must memorize—favoring visible controls over memory-reliant gestures or sequences.
Q: Has the limbic system been proven to be the sole origin of emotions? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:
	•	emotional network
	•	disproved exclusivity
	•	broader brain involvement
	•	limbic centrality

The idea that emotions originate solely from the limbic system is outdated. Emotions arise from multiple brain areas, although the limbic system plays a central coordinating role.
Q: What are the five types of reading, where are they used, and what typographic styles support them? [6.1 Basics of Typography]
A:
	•	linear reading: used in prose (e.g., novels, long articles); serif fonts, 50–75 characters per line, 1.2–1.5× line spacing, calm and harmonious layout
	•	nuanced reading: used in educational or scientific books; one wide and one narrow column, clear headings, structured layout for non-linear entry
	•	selective reading: used to extract targeted info (e.g., brochures, illustrated guides); 1–2 columns, lots of white space, room for illustrations
	•	scanning: used for quick info retrieval (e.g., dictionaries, websites); 2–3 columns, small font, narrow line spacing, bold keywords, sans-serif fonts like Arial or Helvetica
	•	informative reading: used in newspapers, blogs, and nonfiction; short lines, clearly marked sections, bold font styles for navigation

Each reading type corresponds to a specific purpose and content format. Linear reading supports immersive, continuous reading with serif fonts and evenly spaced lines. Nuanced reading allows flexible access within structured texts, often pairing main text with side notes. Selective reading benefits from visual separation and space to highlight key elements. Scanning prioritizes speed and clarity through compact layouts and emphasized keywords. Informative reading facilitates orientation and skimming through concise segments and typographic highlights like bold text.
Q: What are font styles and which four are the most important? [6.1 Basics of Typography]
A:
	•	regular: standard form without styling
	•	bold: thicker and darker for emphasis
	•	italic: slanted version for emphasis or titles
	•	bold italic: combination of bold and italic for strong emphasis

Font styles are variations within a typeface that modify its appearance to convey structure or emphasis. The four most important styles are regular, bold, italic, and bold italic. Regular is the default form; bold adds weight for emphasis; italic slants the text for stylistic or semantic distinction; and bold italic combines both features for maximum emphasis. These styles help create visual hierarchy and improve readability in design.
Q: What role do emotions play in user experience? [1.1 Explanation of Terms]
A:
	•	emotional impact
	•	memory and meaning

Q: What influence does affective state have on product perception? [4.2 Design Principles of Emotional Design]
A:
	•	positive state: more tolerant, creative
	•	negative state: more focused, analytical
	•	mood affects cognition

A user’s emotional state influences how they perceive and interact with a product. Positive moods increase creativity and tolerance for small flaws, while negative moods enhance attention to detail and critical thinking. Therefore, products used in stressful contexts should be especially well-designed to avoid overwhelming users.
Q: What are the hierarchical levels of user needs according to Walter (2011)? [4.3 Emotional Design and Technology]
A:
	•	functionality
	•	reliability
	•	usability
	•	emotional/hedonic value

Walter (2011) adapted Maslow’s hierarchy to UX, proposing that users first require functionality, then reliability and usability, before experiencing higher-level emotional or hedonic satisfaction. Only when these foundational layers are fulfilled can designers aim for user delight or deep emotional engagement.
Q: What is the paradox of choice in user behavior? [1.3 Interaction of Psychology and Design]
A:
	•	too many options
	•	decision fatigue
	•	reduced purchases
	•	satisfaction decrease

The paradox of choice posits that an abundance of options can overwhelm users, reducing their likelihood of making a purchase. Studies (e.g., Schwartz, 2009) show that limited choices often lead to more satisfaction and higher conversion rates.
Q: Which psychological laws and design principles are used to understand and reduce cognitive load in UX? [1.3 Interaction of Psychology and Design]
A:
	•	cognitive load theory
	•	chunking
	•	Miller’s law
	•	Hick’s law
	•	Fitt’s law
	•	choice overload

Cognitive load in UX refers to the mental effort users expend when interacting with a system. To reduce this load, designers apply several principles: cognitive load theory explains how learning and stress affect mental effort; chunking improves memory by grouping information; Miller’s law limits items in working memory to ~7; Hick’s law warns that too many options slow decision-making; Fitt’s law guides the placement and size of UI elements; and choice overload describes how excessive options can reduce satisfaction and action. These principles help designers create more intuitive and efficient user experiences.

Q: Why should fonts not be artificially stretched or compressed? [6.1 Basics of Typography]
A:
It distorts the design; use proper variants instead
Q: What is the difference between push and pull motives? [3.2 Motives and Goals]
A:
	•	push = internal drives
	•	pull = external stimuli
	•	hunger/thirst = push
	•	incentives = pull

Push motives originate from biological or instinctual needs (e.g., hunger), while pull motives are activated by external incentives (e.g., seeing a drink). Both influence motivational strength (Radel et al., 2016; Maslow, 1954).
Q: How do moods influence learning and memory in UX contexts? [3.1 Reward and Avoidance System]
A:
	•	learning enhancement
	•	memory effect
	•	mood-congruent processing
	•	product interaction

Positive moods can enhance information retention and product experimentation. For example, users in a good mood remember brand names better and are more likely to try new products (Lee & Sternthal, 1999).
Q: What is the evolutionary significance of brain structure hierarchy? [2.3 Main Components of a Nerve Cell]
A:
	•	survival functions
	•	layered brain systems
	•	cognitive evolution

Q: What should be considered in a Mixture of similar structures? [6.1 Basics of Typography]
A:
Fonts with similar structure can be mixed if a clear distinction between typefaces remains visible.
Q: What elements can trigger user delight in interface design, according to Nielsen (2017b)? [4.3 Emotional Design and Technology]
A:
	•	animations
	•	tactile transitions
	•	microcopy
	•	high-resolution images
	•	sound interactions

Once basic needs are met, interface elements like animations, gesture-based transitions, humorous or helpful microcopy, vivid images, and sound feedback can evoke emotional responses. However, for true “Deep Delight,” all hierarchical UX needs must be fulfilled, supporting flow and positive user experience.
Q: What cognitive processes are included under the term cognition? [1.1 Explanation of Terms]
A:
	•	attention
	•	memory
	•	problem solving
	•	action control

A:
	•	arousal
	•	valence
	•	dominance
	•	Bradley & Lang (1994)

The dimensional model defines emotions along three axes: arousal (intensity), valence (positivity vs. negativity), and dominance (perceived control). This framework helps classify emotional experiences beyond basic categories.
Q: What are the guidelines for typographic design according to Hyndman (2016)? [6.1 Basics of Typography]
A:
	•	ideal text size: 8.5–12 pt (print), 15–25 px (web)
	•	max line length: 80 characters
	•	use professionally designed fonts
	•	avoid centered or justified continuous text
	•	use capital letters sparingly
	•	avoid using too many fonts
	•	avoid light text on black background for print
	•	don’t stretch or compress fonts artificially
	•	check for proper kerning

Hyndman (2016) summarized nine key guidelines for designing readable and professional typography. These include choosing the right font size depending on medium, limiting line length, selecting quality fonts, and avoiding layout pitfalls like all caps, poor kerning, or distorted letterforms. Proper application of these principles improves legibility, aesthetics, and user experience across both print and digital platforms.
Q: What are the roles of the gyrus cinguli and its subdivisions? [2.2 Limbic System]
A:
	•	affect regulation

Q: Why should emotional evaluations be included in early development stages of UX design? [4.3 Emotional Design and Technology]
A:
	•	ensure user needs are met
	•	prevent negative emotions
	•	validate hedonic quality

Integrating user feedback early allows designers to assess whether products fulfill both pragmatic and emotional needs. Tools like the AttrakDiff and VisAwi questionnaires help measure perceived usability and aesthetics, guiding iterative improvement before launch.
Q: What are small caps, serifs, and kerning in typography? [6.1 Basics of Typography]
A:
	•	small caps: uppercase-shaped letters with adjusted height and weight
	•	serifs: small strokes on letter ends; absent in sans-serif fonts
	•	kerning: adjustment of space between individual characters

Small caps are a separate font style where all letters use the form of uppercase characters but are shorter and designed for visual harmony with lowercase text. Serifs are the small projecting features at the ends of strokes in letters; serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman) are viewed as formal and readable in print, while sans-serif fonts (e.g., Arial) are cleaner and more common in digital contexts. Kerning is the fine-tuning of spacing between character pairs (like “A” and “V”) to ensure balanced and aesthetically pleasing text. It improves both readability and visual alignment in typography.
Q: How do the Means-End Chain Model and the Valence Method compare in UX research? [4.3 Emotional Design and Technology]
A:
	•	both link product attributes to user needs
	•	Means-End Chain: theoretical model for evaluation
	•	Valence Method: practical, interactive, time-intensive tool
	•	Valence uses laddering based on Means-End Chain logic

Both models examine how product features affect emotional user responses via need satisfaction. The Means-End Chain Model is a conceptual framework, while the Valence Method is an applied tool that builds on its logic. The Valence Method adds real-time interaction and reflection, offering deeper but more time-consuming insights into emotional design.

Q: What are motives and how do they relate to motivation? [3.2 Motives and Goals]
A:
	•	motives = inner needs
	•	goal orientation
	•	emotional drive
	•	time-stable preferences

Motives reflect stable internal desires or needs (e.g., achievement, power, affiliation). Motivation arises when internal arousal is coupled with a goal, making motivation a goal-directed drive (Kroeber-Riel & Gröppel-Klein, 2019).
Q: How does relevance influence purchasing decisions? [3.4 Relevance, Credibility, and Differentiation]
A:
	•	goal alignment
	•	reward anticipation
	•	need state influence

Q: What are basic and secondary emotions, and how are they distinguished? [3.1 Reward and Avoidance System]
A:
	•	basic emotions = innate, universal
	•	secondary emotions = social, reflective
	•	Ekman’s classification
	•	emotional spectrum

Basic emotions (anger, fear, disgust, sadness, happiness) are genetically embedded and culturally universal. Some researchers add shame, surprise, and embarrassment. Secondary emotions—like guilt, pride, envy, and love—arise from deeper self-awareness and complex social relationships (Ekman, 2016).
Q: What is the overjustification effect and how does it affect motivation? [7.2 Design of the Flow Experience]
A:
	•	intrinsic motivation is undermined
	•	caused by excessive external rewards
	•	enjoyment becomes task-independent

The overjustification effect occurs when a person who initially engages in an activity out of intrinsic motivation begins to associate it primarily with external rewards (e.g., money, grades). As a result, their natural enjoyment or interest decreases. The task becomes a means to an end rather than something pursued for its own value—potentially disrupting flow and long-term engagement.
Q: How is user experience addressed in medical and care settings? [1.2 User Experience over Time]
A:
	•	assistive robotics
	•	emotional design
	•	HRI (human–robot interaction)
	•	psychological well-being

In healthcare, user experience includes not only functionality but also emotional effects. Social robots are designed to improve psychological well-being and foster trust, highlighting the emotional dimension of human–robot interaction.
Q: What is typography and what is its main function in design? [6.1 Basics of Typography]
A:
	•	supports reading
	•	ensures efficient text presentation
	•	adapts to medium and purpose
	•	enhances readability

Typography refers to the design and arrangement of written text with the goal of presenting it efficiently and supporting the reading process. Its primary function is to help the reader’s eyes glide effortlessly over the text without causing distraction. Typography should simplify reading, not interfere with it. Its effectiveness depends on factors such as medium (print vs. digital) and the purpose of the content (e.g., informational vs. advertising), which influence typographic choices and guidelines.
Q: What are the five traits in the Five Factor Model of Personality? [3.3 Personality Traits of the Human Being]
A:
	•	extraversion
	•	agreeableness
	•	conscientiousness
	•	neuroticism
	•	openness to experience

The Big Five model reduces human personality to five major traits. These are sociability (extraversion), empathy (agreeableness), perfectionism (conscientiousness), emotional stability (neuroticism), and curiosity (openness). It’s widely used but lacks detail for some applications.
Q: What are Maslow’s five hierarchical needs? [3.2 Motives and Goals]
A:
	•	physiological
	•	safety
	•	love and belonging
	•	esteem
	•	self-actualization

Maslow’s theory arranges needs in a hierarchy: starting from survival needs (like hunger) to safety, social connection, esteem, and self-actualization. Once one level is satisfied, the next becomes motivationally relevant.
Q: What is hemispheric lateralization and how is it often misunderstood? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	functional specialization
	•	left vs. right brain
	•	language asymmetry
	•	myth of strict division

Hemispheric lateralization refers to the specialization of certain functions in one brain hemisphere. While language functions are reliably lateralized, the popular belief that logic or creativity reside strictly in one hemisphere is an oversimplification.
Q: What are the components and role of the diencephalon? [2.1 Anatomy of the Human Brain]
A:
	•	thalamus
