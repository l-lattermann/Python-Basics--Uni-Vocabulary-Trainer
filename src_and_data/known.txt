Q: What are stepper motors and how do they work? [Actuators]
A: Stepper motors use multiple coils as electromagnets to attract gear teeth step-by-step through magnetic pulses, enabling precise incremental movement.
Q: What was the purpose of the WAVE programming language developed in 1973? (History of Mobile Robots)
A: WAVE was specifically created to address the programming needs of robots, enabling better control and coordination.
Q: Why is a compass mandatory in mobile robots using GPS? [Mobile Robot Sensors]
A: While GPS provides position, a compass is needed to determine the orientation of the robot, enabling accurate navigation and heading control (Hertzberg et al., 2012).
Q: What type of joints define a Cartesian or Gantry robot, and what is its spatial capability? (Mechanical Structure)
A: A Cartesian or Gantry robot uses three translational joints (P ∟ P ∟ P) forming a Cartesian coordinate system, resulting in high reachability in 3D space.
Q: What is a typical method to resolve redundancy in inverse kinematics? (Forwards and Backwards Kinematics)
A: A common method for resolving redundancy is optimizing individual joint trajectories to meet criteria such as energy efficiency, obstacle avoidance, or motion smoothness.
Q: What characterizes the SCARA configuration and in which sector is it commonly applied? (Mechanical Structure)
A: The SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) configuration features an R ∥ R ∥ P alignment with two rotational and one prismatic joint in parallel, offering high rigidity in the vertical direction and is widely used in electronics manufacturing.
Q: Which countries had the highest number of industrial robot installations in 2018? (Market Overview)
A: In 2018, China led with 154,032 installations, followed by Japan (55,240), the United States (40,373), South Korea (37,807), and Germany (26,723), according to the International Federation of Robotics.
Q: What makes the human hand a good model for robotic dexterity? (Forwards and Backwards Kinematics)
A: The human hand exemplifies high kinematic dexterity due to its many DOFs and coordinated motion, serving as inspiration for robotic hands aimed at complex manipulation tasks.
Q: What is a parallel robot and when did its development begin? (History of Industrial Robots)
A: Parallel robots, developed since the 1980s, use multiple actuators to simultaneously manipulate workpieces, improving efficiency and precision.
Q: Why is inverse kinematics often mathematically complex? (Forwards and Backwards Kinematics)
A: Inverse kinematics can be mathematically complex because it may involve nonlinear equations, multiple possible solutions, and redundant degrees of freedom, especially in robots with high DOFs.
Q: Why is cybersecurity increasingly important in robotics? (Challenges and Trends)
A: As robots become more networked and remotely accessible, cybersecurity is crucial to prevent unauthorized access that could lead to production halts or safety hazards.
Q: How does a Bernoulli gripper function? [End Effectors]
A: A Bernoulli gripper uses a high-speed airstream created by pressurized air to generate low static pressure, which creates lift and holds the object without direct contact.
Q: What are the core characteristics of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs)? [Characteristics of Mobile Robots]
A: AMRs are mobile, adapt to unknown environments, gather and process environmental data, interact with operators via commands, avoid harm to themselves and surroundings, and process information in real time (Berns & von Puttkamer, 2009).
