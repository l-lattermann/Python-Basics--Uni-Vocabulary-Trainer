Q: What key elements are included in a use case specification?
A: (1) Actors, (2) stakeholders, (3) primary actor, (4) system objective, (5) preconditions and guarantees, (6) main success scenario, (7) extensions, and (8) a numbering scheme for mapping extensions to the main scenario steps.
Q: How does Moser’s model link user expectations with design levels?
A: Moser matches specific product characteristics (e.g., functionality, interface design) with corresponding user expectations. A positive UX occurs when expectations are met consistently across all levels, from basic functionality to emotional and aesthetic engagement.
Q: What distinguishes a good experience from a bad one in UX?
A: A good experience isn’t just about avoiding problems—it involves creating moments of satisfaction, delight, and meaning. According to Hassenzahl, removing annoyances (dissatisfiers) is essential, but adding motivators (satisfiers) creates real value.
Q: Why are user stories especially valuable in agile development?
A: User stories break down requirements into small, manageable units that can be implemented within short timeframes (sprints). They keep the focus on user needs, are easy to prioritize, and help plan development iteratively.
