Q: What are the four sublanguages of SQL and what is their purpose? [1.3 SQL and Relational Database Systems]
A:

	•	DML: Data Manipulation Language → manipulate data (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
	•	DDL: Data Definition Language → define schema structure (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP)
	•	TCL: Transaction Control Language → manage transactions (e.g., COMMIT, ROLLBACK)
	•	DCL: Data Control Language → control user access (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE)

SQL is composed of four functional sublanguages, each targeting a different aspect of database operations. The Data Manipulation Language (DML) handles data-level actions like querying or modifying records. The Data Definition Language (DDL) is used to create or alter the structure of database schemas. Transaction Control Language (TCL) ensures safe and consistent execution of grouped DML commands. Lastly, Data Control Language (DCL) manages user permissions and access control to database resources.
Q: What are some common relational database management systems (RDBMSs)? [1.3 SQL and Relational Database Systems]
A:

	•	MariaDB → open-source, MySQL spin-off, free for commercial use
	•	Oracle Database → commercial enterprise-grade RDBMS
	•	IBM DB2 → commercial, large-scale database solution
	•	Microsoft SQL Server → commercial, Windows-optimized RDBMS

MariaDB is a popular open-source relational DBMS derived from MySQL and used widely in small to medium-sized applications, offering broad platform support without licensing fees. In contrast, commercial RDBMSs like Oracle Database, IBM DB2, and Microsoft SQL Server are proprietary systems commonly deployed in enterprise environments with advanced scalability, security, and support features.
