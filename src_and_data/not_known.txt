Q: Who coined the term “user experience design” and why?
A: The term was popularized by cognitive psychologist Donald Norman in the 1980s while at Apple. He emphasized the need to design technology that aligns with human psychology, making systems intuitive and emotionally satisfying rather than just functional.
Q: What shift occurred in HCI with the rise of personal computing?
A: As non-experts began using computers in the 1980s and 1990s, HCI shifted from training users to adapt to systems, toward designing systems that adapt to users. This user-centered perspective laid the foundation for modern UX practices.
Q: What role did the internet and dotcom boom play in UX?
A: The rise of the web changed software marketing: users could try or preview software before purchase, making usability and user experience central to purchasing decisions. The dotcom boom pushed companies to invest in UX to remain competitive.
Q: What are “human factors” in UX?
A: Human factors refer to designing systems that align with human physical and cognitive abilities. They are especially critical in safety-sensitive environments like aviation, nuclear control, or healthcare, where errors can have serious consequences.
Q: What is the DIN EN ISO 9241 standard?
A: It’s a set of international standards defining principles of usability and human-centered design. It guides UX professionals in designing systems that are effective, efficient, and satisfying for users.
Q: How is “experience” defined in the context of UX?
A: Experience refers to the subjective, emotional, and cognitive response to using a product or service. It is shaped by past interactions, personal expectations, and contextual factors, and includes both real-time perception and retrospective evaluation.
Q: How is “user experience” (UX) defined according to DIN EN ISO 9241-210?
A: User experience is defined as the perceptions and reactions of a person resulting from the actual or expected use of a product, system, or service. This includes emotions, thoughts, preferences, physical and psychological responses, behaviors, and accomplishments that occur before, during, and after use.
Q: How does DIN EN ISO 9241-210 define a “user”?
A: A user is anyone who interacts with a system, whether directly or indirectly. This includes customers who buy and use the product, and also employees who operate, maintain, or support it within an organization.
Q: What factors shape the mindset and behavior of users?
A: Users are influenced by physical and mental abilities, emotional states, cultural background, social environments, education, and personal experiences. These factors form an individual mental model and determine how users interact with systems.
Q: What is a mental model in UX design?
A: A mental model is a user’s internal understanding of how a system works. While often simplified and not technically accurate, it helps users predict system behavior. A mismatch between the mental model and actual system logic can lead to user errors.
Q: What is a conceptual model in interface design?
A: It’s the designer’s simplified representation of how a system works, crafted to match the user’s mental model. Unlike the technical implementation, it focuses on making the system understandable and transparent for users.
Q: What is the DIN EN ISO 9241-11 definition of a usage objective?
A: A usage objective is defined as the intended result of a task or work activity. If a product allows a user to achieve their intended goal effectively in the given context, it is considered “fit for use.”
Q: What are Hassenzahl’s three levels of goals in UX?
A: (1) Motor goals deal with physical actions (how), (2) action goals describe specific activities (what), and (3) being goals reflect motivations and identities (why). Positive user experiences emerge when systems support all three levels, especially the being goals.
Q: What is meant by the “context of use” in UX design?
A: The context of use includes the user, their goals, tasks, available resources, and their physical, technical, social, and organizational environment. It shapes how a product is experienced and what design is appropriate for a given situation.
Q: What are physical and social factors in the usage context?
A: Physical factors include devices, screens, and environmental conditions (e.g., lighting). Social factors refer to norms, privacy concerns, and behavioral expectations, like the need for discreet notifications in public.
Q: Why is UX design considered more strategic than usability engineering?
A: UX design doesn’t just enhance functionality—it impacts business models and branding by differentiating products through experience rather than features. It influences not only interaction quality but also corporate identity and customer loyalty.
Q: What are Peter Morville’s seven facets of the UX Honeycomb?
A: (1) Useful: fulfills a real need; (2) Usable: easy to operate; (3) Desirable: aesthetically and emotionally appealing; (4) Findable: easy to locate and navigate; (5) Accessible: usable by people with disabilities; (6) Credible: inspires user trust; (7) Valuable: provides benefit to both user and business.
Q: How do Hartson and Pyla define the components of user experience?
A: They outline four key components: (1) Usability – task performance ease; (2) Usefulness – practical value; (3) Emotional Impact – feelings evoked by use; (4) Meaningfulness – long-term personal significance of the product to the user.
Q: What is the focus of customer experience management (CEM)?
A: Customer experience management focuses on shaping the entire brand and service experience from the customer’s perspective, particularly around purchasing decisions and building loyalty. It emphasizes all customer touchpoints with the brand and is closely related to brand perception and marketing strategy.
Q: Why is UX design relevant to a company’s internal organization?
A: Implementing UX design successfully requires alignment across departments, from developers to management. A company must adopt a user-centered mindset and often restructure workflows and strategy to prioritize consistent, meaningful user experiences across all touchpoints.
Q: How did UX design contribute to Apple’s turnaround?
A: Apple succeeded by combining management support with high-quality UX design. Products like the iMac and iPod emphasized aesthetic value and emotional appeal. Even when technically inferior, their symbolic product value and branding (e.g., white headphones) created strong consumer attachment.
Q: What are the risks of a UX-driven strategy according to Buxton?
A: A UX-driven strategy can lead to product failures, such as the PowerMac G4 Cube, where design aesthetics harmed functionality. However, Buxton argues that such risks are part of innovation and can ultimately contribute to long-term brand success.
Q: What are the three core activities in the UX design process?
A: According to Jonas (2006), the UX design process includes: (1) analysis – understanding the current state, (2) projection – generating ideas, and (3) synthesis – developing and implementing concrete design solutions. These activities span the broader macroprocess.
Q: What are the four microprocess phases in UX design?
A: The microprocess involves: (1) research – collecting user data, (2) analysis – deriving user needs, (3) synthesis – generating and refining design ideas, and (4) realization – implementing and testing solutions. These phases often repeat iteratively.
Q: What makes the UX design process iterative?
A: UX design relies on constant feedback from users. Solutions are repeatedly tested and refined, with each round of testing feeding into the next analysis phase. This iterative approach improves alignment with real user needs and enhances product quality over time.
Q: What is the difference between projection and synthesis in UX design?
A: Projection involves generating ideas and envisioning possible solutions, while synthesis refers to shaping and concretizing these ideas into implementable concepts. In UX, both are grounded in what is technically feasible and directly usable by the end user.
Q: Why is user-centered design usually focused on the present rather than future visions?
A: User-centered design emphasizes solving immediate and concrete user problems rather than speculating on long-term futures. The focus is on practicality, feasibility, and immediate applicability, rather than visionary design that may take years to implement.
Q: How does the revised Double Diamond model enhance UX practice?
A: The updated model adds a “methods bank,” integrating specific techniques and design principles. This recognizes that successful UX work is not only about diverging and converging, but also about applying the right tools to ensure user-centeredness and iterative learning.
Q: How does the DIN EN ISO 9241-210 model describe UX design?
A: This model emphasizes an iterative user-centered process that continually tests and refines solutions based on user feedback. It outlines the importance of aligning product behavior with user expectations but doesn’t focus on divergence/convergence or method choice.
Q: How does Moser’s model link user expectations with design levels?
A: Moser matches specific product characteristics (e.g., functionality, interface design) with corresponding user expectations. A positive UX occurs when expectations are met consistently across all levels, from basic functionality to emotional and aesthetic engagement.
Q: What are Jesse James Garrett’s five elements of UX design?
A: Garrett identifies five levels: (1) Strategy – goals of users and company; (2) Scope – features and content; (3) Structure – logical relationships and navigation; (4) Skeleton (Grid) – layout and interface structure; (5) Surface – visuals and interaction elements. Together, these levels move from abstract goals to concrete designs.
Q: How does Garrett distinguish between functional and informational UX?
A: Garrett divides each level into two perspectives: the function side, focusing on user tasks and actions, and the information side, focusing on content and meaning. This dual view helps identify both interaction and content-related design issues.
Q: What are the guiding principles of user-centered design according to the UK Design Council?
A: Core principles include: (1) user-centeredness, (2) inclusive and visual communication, (3) collaboration and co-creation, and (4) iteration. These guide the integration of UX into business culture and processes.
Q: How can UX activities be aligned with business objectives?
A: UX teams should prioritize projects that support business goals, such as reducing user errors, increasing task efficiency, or improving conversion. Linking UX metrics (like success rate or time-on-task) to business KPIs makes the value of UX clearer to stakeholders.
Q: What key insight does Hassenzahl draw from the Wakeup Light example?
A: The product’s value lies not in its appearance but in the experience it creates. Hassenzahl stresses designing for emotional quality and user needs rather than sticking to traditional forms, urging designers to begin with the desired experience.
Q: What does Bill Buxton’s juicer example reveal about UX?
A: Buxton compares three juice squeezers with similar functions but vastly different user experiences. The OrangeX stands out because it reduces physical effort at the end of the pressing motion, showing how small design refinements can significantly enhance experience.
Q: How does Amazon connect UX with business goals?
A: UX improvements at Amazon serve both user needs and business interests. For instance, offering Prime membership during checkout not only informs users but also boosts subscriptions—aligning a smoother experience with increased revenue.
Q: What is the purpose of the analysis phase in user-centered design?
A: The analysis phase identifies user needs, intentions, tasks, and the context of system use. It provides the foundation for meaningful user requirements that guide the design and development of user-centered solutions.
Q: Which methods are commonly used in the analysis phase of UX design?
A: Common methods include contextual inquiry, touchpoint analysis, customer journey mapping, and personas. These approaches help uncover user behavior, pain points, and goals across different stages and contexts of interaction.
Q: Why is direct user engagement essential in the analysis phase?
A: Direct engagement—through interviews, observation, and participation—provides authentic insights into user needs and behaviors. It ensures that design decisions are based on real experiences, not just assumptions or abstract data.
