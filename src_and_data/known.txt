Q: What is HAVING used for in SQL? [2.4 Queries with Group Formation (GROUP BY)]
A:

 HAVING   
	restricts output after grouping with GROUP BY
     	SELECT Continent FROM Country
        WHERE Percentage = 100
        GROUP BY Continent
        HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5;
        → shows continents with ≥5 countries fully located in them

The HAVING clause filters groups, not individual rows. Unlike WHERE, which limits rows before grouping, HAVING applies conditions after grouping has taken place—usually with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, or AVG.
Q: Define Database Management System (DBMS). [1.1 Basic Concepts of the Relational Data Model]
A:
A DBMS is software used to create, manage, and interact with databases. It provides tools for defining structures, storing data, and ensuring integrity. Examples include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.
Q: What is an RDBMS? [1.1 Basic Concepts of the Relational Data Model]
A:

	•	RDBMS
	•	relational organization
	•	DBMS subtype

A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a specific type of database management system designed to handle relationally organized data. In such systems, data is structured in tables with rows and columns, and the RDBMS provides functions for querying, updating, and managing this tabular data according to relational principles.
Q: What is FROM used for in SELECT … FROM …? [2.1 Querying Data (SELECT)]
A:
	SELECT * FROM Country;

The FROM clause tells the system which table to retrieve data from. Here, it selects all columns from the table Country.
Q: What is WHERE used for in SELECT … WHERE …? [2.2 Query Data with Condition (WHERE)]
A:
	SELECT Name, Capital FROM Country WHERE Continent = 'Asia';

The WHERE clause filters rows based on a condition. This query returns only countries located in the continent “Asia”.
Q: What is ORDER BY used for in SQL? [2.3 Sort Query Output (ORDER BY)]
A:
 ORDER BY  
	sorts the result set based on one or more columns
        SELECT Name FROM Country WHERE Continent = ‘America’ ORDER BY Population DESC;
        → returns countries in America sorted by population (descending)

The ORDER BY clause allows results of a SQL query to be sorted by one or more columns, making it easier to read and analyze the output. By default, the sorting is ascending (ASC), but it can be set to descending (DESC). If unspecified, ascending order is used.
Q: Define Domain. [1.1 Basic Concepts of the Relational Data Model]
A:
A domain is the set of valid values that an attribute can hold.
